A brief description on loads...

This mainly deals with Primary Transportation where it travels from one distributer to the next distributer (from A to B types). Its type of logistics is Linehaul which essentially is the movement of cargo from one major city to the next. An alternative description is that of Truckload shipping which is the movementof large amounts of homogeneous cargo, generally the amount necessary to fill an entire semi-trailer or intermodal container. A truckload carrier is a trucking company that generally contracts an entire trailer-load to a single customer.
