The purpose of the organisation module is to allow users to manage master data and access control to the other modules of the system.

When working with the various Trackmatic apis the first thing you will need to know is which organisation you are working with. The organisation represents a tenant of the Trackmatic system. Accessing an organisation requires an [access token]({{'/rest' | prepend: site.github.url}}) for that organisation.
